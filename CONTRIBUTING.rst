Contribution
============
Thank you for considering contributing to EpiTator!

If you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request.
`This <https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/>`_ manual is a good start on how to
contribute to open source projects.

Please write tests for the features you want to add and make sure to not add dependencies on additional libraries
(if avoidable).
We highly appreciate bug fixes (or reports), improvements on the documentation, and tests.
However, we would be hesitant to add new annotators to the core repository.
If you want to develop a new annotator it can be done in a separate repository
or PyPI package, and we are happy to add references to external annotators to the EpiTator documentation upon request.
